How do concepts of mental life vary across cultures? By asking simple questions about humans, animals, and other entities—e.g., Do beetles get hungry? remember things? feel love?—we reconstructed concepts of mental life from the bottom up among adults (N=711) and children (ages 6-12y, N=693) in the US, Ghana, Thailand, China, and Vanuatu.

This repo includes analyses of the quantitative data from these four studies, which took place in five international field sites as part of the [Mind and Spirit Project](https://themindandspiritproject.stanford.edu/#Home).

**Datasets** for each of the 10 samples included in these analyses are [here](https://github.com/kgweisman/beetles/tree/master/data).

**Analysis scripts** are organized by type of analysis; the primary results reported in the main text can be found [here](https://github.com/kgweisman/beetles/tree/master/analyses/efa_oblique.nb.html). To view the results of an analysis in an HTML file, download the R Notebook (extension: .nb.html) to a folder on your computer and re-open it (from that folder) in a web browser -- or use the [htmlpreview.github.com](htmlpreview.github.com) links provided below. To view and manipulate the code, download the R Markdown file (extension: .Rmd) and open it in RStudio.
